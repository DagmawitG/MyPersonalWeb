                <p>I am a Data Scientist & Professional Educator at RStudio PBC. I am an international keynote speaker, and I regularly lead workshops and develop online learning materials on topics like reproducible research, machine learning, and data visualization. My teaching materials have been used by NASA, Pew Research Center, University of Oregon, and now RStudio. I am also a co-author of the book blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown.</p><br>
                <p>I received my PhD in psychology and quantitative methods from Vanderbilt University in 2008. Prior to joining RStudio, I was an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University, and an Associate Professor at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). While at OHSU, I was an NIH-funded Principal Investigator and the Assistant Director of the Center for Spoken Language Understanding. I was nominated for a distinguished faculty award for outstanding teaching, and was awarded an excellence in graduate education award from the OHSU School of Medicine. My research has been published in Pediatrics, Autism Research, and other peer-reviewed journals.</p>
