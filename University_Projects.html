            <p align="center">UniversityThese workshops provide a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning: concepts, methods, and R code. <br>Participants learn how to train and assess predictive models with several common machine learning algorithms,<br> as well as how to do feature engineering to improve the predictive accuracy of their models.<br> We focus on teaching intuitive explanations of the models and best practices for predictive modeling.<br> Along the way, we introduce several core tidymodels packages, which provide a grammar for modeling<br> that makes it easy to the right thing, and harder to accidentally do the wrong thing.</p>
