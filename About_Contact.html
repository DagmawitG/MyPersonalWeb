            My name is Dagmawit Getachew. I was born on May 3, 2000. I am the youngest child in my family. As the youngest member, my family is very protective and caring. During my childhood, my mom didn’t let me go out and play with kids instead I used to stay at home and play with her. Personally, I think this had a huge effect on my personality today. When I was three years old, I joined a School known as ‘National School’. I was really shy and had only few friends.

      As I was promoted to first grade, I joined Hill Side School. I had unforgettable memories there. I had lots of friends and so much fun especially in High School. I had good grades and I was loved and appreciated by my teachers. My High School life is probably the happiest time of my life. Many consider their University lives to be the best, but to me high school is better, because it has more fun and less workload. There are too many memorable moments to remember. During boring classes, we used to eat, sing and talk while the teacher wasn’t looking. My friends and I used to volunteer in different organizations. We were really active and motivated. We used to spend our summer break volunteering and fundraising. My high school life was a fun period in my life, because apart from studying I had no responsibilities.

        In 2018, I joined Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. Being a freshman was difficult at first but luckily, I met some girls who I now call my sisters. We share dorm and are really close to one another. Since University is a half-way house between leaving home and getting a job there are lots of responsibilities that comes with it. Degree isn’t the only thing you get when joining a University.
         It’s so much more than that; it teaches how to be independent and accountable for your own actions. It makes you stronger and wiser. During my two years of stay, I have grown to be mature and responsible. Life at AAiT is a great experience that I plan to make the most out of.
