                    Student’s life on University campus revolves around going to classes, studying in the library or in their own room, getting involved in co-curricular activities in the university and sometimes hanging out with their friends to have fun. For many students who live in students accommodation being away from their family will require them to be independent and some students need quite some time to get adjusted to their new environment or they will be homesick or stressed. They need to practice housekeeping, to manage a budget, and to find their way around new place. Stress is also a part of every student’s daily life. It can be very damaging for students when stress becomes excessive. It can harm student's health, happiness, work performance, relationships and personal development. There are many causes of stress among university students. Among the causes are a lot of assignments, exams, homesickness, financial problem and future career planning.
        
              
                    The first cause of stress among university students is a lot of assignments. Sometimes a student need to take six to seven classes per semester and the professors can assign new assignments for each classes. The students need to submit all the assignments before the deadline and as the deadline closes in pressure keeps building up. It can monumental task to complete two to three assignments a day or sometimes up to seven per week. Thus, the students will not have enough time to concentrate on the assignments as they also need to do other things such as attending classes, getting involved in co-curricular activities. Thus, the students will be stressed because of lack of time to finish the assignments. 
             
                    Students who live away from their home in a student accommodation being away from their family, university students will feel homesick. The students can become homesick because they miss their family and they still cannot adapt to their new environment at the University. As a result, they will feel stressed because maybe they keep thinking about going home to see their family. Because of this they would not be able to concentrate on their studies.

                   Stress permeates almost every aspect of society and has now become a normal experience for most students. There are many known negative implications of stressful life, circumstances on personal health. Life as a university student basically demands a good time management on the part of the student. Those who can manage that time well despite all the stress and work well under pressure can prosper in their future endeavors.
